          <p>I spent a majority of my life playing basketball. I saw my career go
          from stand out prep athlete, to earning a full ride scholarship to a
          division 1 university, to playing professionally in the UK and
          Germany.</p>

        <div class="image" src="images/friends.jpeg" alt="Friends">
          <p>I have a very close group of friends who I can rely on when I need
          them most. I am thankful for them even though we sometimes have our
          disagreements.</p>

        <div class="image" src="images/family.jpeg" alt="Family">
          <p>I love my family more than anything in the world! They are my why and
          my reason for pursuing this career change, and I am laser focused on
          working hard to achieve this goal for not only myself but especially
          them!</p>

        <div class="image" src="images/web.jpeg" alt="Why Web Dev?">
          <p>I have always had a strong passion for computers and technology since
          my early years. I am very excited to get the proper structure for
          building a calculated foundation to continue to work towards becoming
          a full time employed software engineer.</p>
